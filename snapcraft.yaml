  INTRODUCING LNGCNV

  The acronym 'lngcnv' may signify e.g., a 'language converter', a 'linguistic converter', or a 'lenguaje convertido' (Spanish for 'converted language').

  lngcnv is capable of presenting the precise pronunciation of a phrase using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). It can also translate between various dialects of a language and convert between different orthographic norms.

  The program can accept input in the form of a word or text either directly through the command line or by being included in a file, such as a lengthy book. There is also a REPL (read-eval-print loop) mode available for interactive use.

  Six modern and ancient languages, including a range of dialects, are currently supported.

  The program's source code and linguistic algorithms were created entirely from scratch and are distributed under the MIT License. lngcnv is written in Rust for high performance, code correctness, and ease of long-term development.

  To display the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) characters accurately, it is recommended to use one of the following fonts - Charis SIL, Doulos SIL, or Gentium Plus. When showing IPA characters in the terminal, it is best to use the Unicode font Noto Sans Mono.
